# mancala-web
This repository contains an Elm-based web game. You can check it out at <https://thomasfermi.github.io/mancala-web/>

I want to thank jhbrown on the Elm Slack channel for help on the visual design using elm-ui!

TODO:
1. Code clean up, and proper formatting.
2. Improve visuals
3. Give different AI strengths as options
